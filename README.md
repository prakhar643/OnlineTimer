# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
The Online Timer is a simple yet functional web application built using React.js, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage time efficiently with two core features: a Countdown Timer and a Stopwatch. Users can easily set a timer, start, pause, and reset it, as well as track elapsed time using the stopwatch feature. When the countdown reaches zero, an alarm sound plays to alert the user. The application supports both light mode and dark mode for a better user experience. The project follows a modular structure and uses modern React hooks for state management. It is fully responsive and designed to work across different screen sizes, making it suitable for desktop and mobile devices. This project is ideal for demonstrating front-end development skills and serves as a practical tool for time management.
